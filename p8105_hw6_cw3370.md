# Problem 1

``` r
birthweight_df <- read_csv("data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = factor(babysex,
                     levels = c(1,2),
                     labels = c("male","female")),
    frace = factor(frace,
                   levels = c(1,2,3,4,8,9),
                   labels = c("White","Black","Asian","Puerto Rican","Other","Unkown")),
    malform = factor(malform,
                     levels = c(0,1),
                     labels = c("absense","present")),
    mrace = factor(mrace,
               levels = c(1,2,3,4,8),
               labels = c("White","Black","Asian","Puerto Rican","Other"))
) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

based on knowledge for the factors that underly birthweight, l choose
several factors, including:
bhead,blength,frace,malform,mrace,ppwt,wtgain,smoken and then l make
plots and conduct SLR of birthweight versus each factor to see whether
there are potential relationship(checking plot and R^2).Finally l choose
bhead and blength.
